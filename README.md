# First stage of SpaceX falcon 9 rocket will land successfully with Data Science
**Project:**  
         Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. 
         
**Task:**
        Task is to predict the first stage of SpaceX falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. For this we have to complete different task like Data collection, web scrapping, data wrangling, EDA with SQL, data visualization,site launching, Dashboard, Classification models. which is given below-

- [x] CLASSSIFICATION MODELS- https://github.com/khushiyadav2022/capstone-project/blob/ac7e6e71ab8d900533a0a77d628a479a785524de/SpaceX_Machine%20Learning%20Prediction_Part_5.ipynb

**Conclusion:**<br>
VISUALIZATION CONCLUSION-

- CCAFS SLC 40 have higher Launch Site among all.<br>
- CCAFS SLC 40 have higher Launch Site when Payload Mass(kg)<7000.<br>
- Flight Number between 60-80, orbit type is VLEO.<br>
- Strong relationship between ISS orbit v/s Payload Mass range(2000-3000) and between GTO orbit v/s Payload Mass range(4000-8000).<br>
- Launch success rate has increased from 2013 to 2020.<br>

LAUNCH SITE CONCLUSION-

 launch sites are in proximity to the equator and the coast. The launch sites in close proximity to the coast for safety reasons.
the distances between a launch site to its proximities is as follows:<br>
- Highway distance=0.5834<br>
- Railroad distance=1.2845<br>
- City distance=51.4341<br>

DASHBOARD CONCLUSION

- KSC LC-39A have high success count around 41.7% among all.<br>
- KSC LC-39A have 76.9% success rate and 23.1% failure rate.<br>
- Low weighted payload performs better then higher payload.<br>

CLASSIFICATION CONCLUSION

- Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-nearest neighbours and  Decision Tree have the same accuracy 83.3%<br>
